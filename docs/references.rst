.. argparse::
   :module: rdk
   :func: get_command_parser
   :prog: rdk
   :nodescription:

   Although the sub-commands have their own options, flags, and parameters specific to the functions they perform, the RDK has some options that can be used to override the default behavior related to the identity and credentials used by the tool, as well as which region the sub-commands will target.  These are common to any invocation, and can be used in conjunction with all of the sub-commands.
